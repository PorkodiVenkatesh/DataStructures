## Palindrome

String -> s and the reverse of String s -> rev_s
- If the string (s) and the reverse of string (rev_s) are same, then the string is a palindrome
- Eg: s = mam , rev_s = mam, s and rev_s are same, "mam" is palindrome
- Eg: s = hello, rev_s =olleh,  s and rev_s are not same, "hello" is not a palindrome
- Click [here](Palindrome.java) to see the code for palindrome

## Anagrams

String -> s1 and another String s2 
- If the a string (s2) can be derived/formed from the another string (s1), then s1 and s2 are anagrams
- Eg: s1 = signature and s2 = a true sign 
  - character and  occurence are same. s is appeared once in s1 and it also appeared once in s2.
  - s1 and s2 are anagrams
- Eg: s1 = a gentleman and s2 = elegant man
  - s1 and s2 are anagrams
- Click [here](./Anagrams.java) to see the code for Anagrams
