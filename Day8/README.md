## BigInteger

- Java provides some primitives, such as int or long, to perform integer operations. But sometimes, we need to store numbers, which overflow the available limits for those data types. 
- If your number is really big, we can store them using BigInteger
- BigInteger is a class defined in the java.math package
- **Note: You can manipulation with BigInteger with only another Big Integer.**
