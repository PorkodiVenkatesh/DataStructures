## Why DataStructure and Algorithms
Library, dictionary and closet -> organising is useful -> easier to search

app -> install and uninstall
main reason to uninstall
	storage -> space 
	speed -> time 
mandatory need to look when we develop an app
that's why we are learning ds and algo


## DS - Types
-> Primitive -> only one value -> integers (byte,short, int, long), decimals (long, float), boolean and char
-> Non primitive   -> multiple values or collections of values
 -> Linear  -> line -> one after other -> Arrays/ArrayList, stack, queue and linkedlist
	-> Eg: library, dictionary, biscuit, clothes in closet, color pencils in a box, standing in a line
 -> Non Linear -> hiearchical -> trees and graphs
	 -> Eg: Family tree, Country-States-District tree, folders in computer, dns in internet, google maps

## Array
-> Storing only homogenous elmets -> same datatypes
-> size is fixed

how to get an size from user 
how to declare an array
how to get the array values or elemts
printing them using for and for each loop

## Arraylist
-> class in the collection framework
-> java.util
-> dynamic array
-> when ? not sure abt size.. also size is increasing after some of point

how to declare an arraylist
how to get the arraylist values or elemts
printing them using for and for each loop

## Problems:

1. Print all the even numbers in the array
2. Print all the odd numbers in the array
3. Print all the numbers in the even indices of the array
4. Print all the numbers in the  odd indices of the array
5. Min and max number in the array
6. Min and max even number in the array
7. Min and max odd number in the array
