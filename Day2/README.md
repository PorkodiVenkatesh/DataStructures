## Day2

- Examples of Linear and Non linear data structure
- Arrays -> Same types + size is fixed
- Arrays 2d -> which has rows and cols 
- ArrayList -> size is not fixed

### stacks
 - One above the other
 - Principle: Last In First Out (LIFO) (FILO)
 - Representation:  only one end to insert and delete

### queues
 - one after the other
 - Principle: First In First Out (FIFO) (LILO)
 - Representation  - 2 ends 
       - i can insert/ join a line at the back
       - once i got served/ i can come out of the line at the front

### Linked list
 - nodes linked to each other
 - one node has an reference for the other node
 - like a train
 - real time eg: youtube/any playlist, going back and front in the web pages
 
### Tree
 - hierarchical
 - nodes and children for the nodes
 
### Graphs
 - nodes connected to nodes
 - google maps

### Static DataStructure 
- a datastructure which has fixed size/ size is fixed 
- Arrays

### Dynamic DS
- size is not fixed changes based on the operations
- al, ll, stacks and queues

### ADT - Abstract DataType
- just define what are the operation i can perform on a ds not how its done
- commonly used ADT -  list Adt, stack Adt, queue Adt

## Demo codes
-  ListADT (Arraylist Methods)
     - al.add(elmt)
     - al.add(index, elmt)
     - al.isEmpty()
     - al.size()
     - al.remove(index)
     - al.contains(elmt)
     - al.indexOf(elmt)
     - al.lastIndexOf(elmt)
     - printing using for loop
     - prinint using for each loop
- Array 2d
- ArrayList 2d 

## Problems

1. Arrayelemts - index
2. Arrayelemts - min
3. Max - Arrayelemts
4. Square it
5. OddFirst Even Next
6. EvenFirst Odd Next   
7. Right Shift for K times
8. Left Shift for K times
9. Printing the Duplicate Elements in an array
10. Printing the left diagonal elements in a 2d array
11. Printing the right diagonal elements in a 2d array
12. Printing the edge elements in a 2d array
13. Printing the multiple of 3 in a 2d array
