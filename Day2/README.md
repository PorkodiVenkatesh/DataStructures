## Day2

- Examples of Linear and Non linear data structure
- Arrays -> Same types + size is fixed
- Arrays 2d -> which has rows and cols 
- ArrayList -> size is not fixed

### stacks
 - One above the other
 - Principle: Last In First Out (LIFO) (FILO)
 - Representation:  only one end to insert and delete
 
 |        |

 |........|

### queues
 - one after the other
 - Principle: First In First Out (FIFO) (LILO)
 - Representation   -> 2 ends -> i can insert/ join a line at the back
                               -> once i got served/ i can come out of the line at the front
        -------------------
back                         front
        --------------------

### Linked list
 - nodes linked to each other
 - one node has an reference for the other node
 - like a train
 - real time eg: youtube/any playlist, going back and front in the web pages
 
### Tree
 - hierarchical
 - nodes and children for the nodes
 
### Graphs
 - nodes connected to nodes
 - google maps

### Static DataStructure 
- a datastructure which has fixed size/ size is fixed 
- Arrays

### Dynamic DS
- size is not fixed changes based on the operations
- al, ll, stacks and queues

### ADT - Abstract DataType
- just define what are the operation i can perform on a ds not how its done
- commonly used ADT -  list Adt, stack Adt, queue Adt

### Demo codes
- Arraylist Methods
- Array 2d
- Arraylist 2d 

## Problems

1. Arrayelemts - index
2. Arrayelemts - min
3. Max - Arrayelemts
4. Square it
5. OddFirst Even Next
6. EvenFirst Odd Next
