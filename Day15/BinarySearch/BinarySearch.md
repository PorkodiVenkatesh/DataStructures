# Binary Search

Binary Search is a searching algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array.

In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array.

Binary search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items. If the elements are not sorted already, we need to sort them first.

## Working 

> Note: Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a **sorted array** by **repeatedly dividing the search interval in half**. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to **O(Log n)**.
